sections:

  - title: Under the Sea
    description: Belize’s coast shelters some of the most impressive eco-systems in the world. The balmy Caribbean sea hides, most notably, the largest coral reef in the Western Hemisphere. Add technicolour marine life and you have all you need for breathtaking aquatic adventures. So sling on your snorkel, or don that wetsuit, and discover an underwater world that will leave you reeling for more.

      - title: Belize Barrier Reef
        description: 560 miles of technicolor reefs stretch off the Belizean coast from Cancun to Honduras. This eco-treasure invites snorkelers and divers to its crystalline waters, offering rare glimpses at an enchanting aquatic world. Tropical fish, sea turtles and manatees will guide you around the stunning reef.

      - title: Blue Hole
        description: This natural curiosity has lured divers to its depths for generations. Ever since Jacques Cousteau named it as one of the top 10 diving spots in the world, it’s been remarkably popular. This sinkhole, noticeable by the far darker waters it hosts,  reaches a depth of 410 ft, making it the largest of its kind. It’s said the waters clear the deeper you go, revealing the limestone cave features that lie below.

      - title: Shark Ray Alley
        description: Swim with sharks! It may go against everything that Jaws! taught you but the docile nurse sharks and impressive southern stingrays create a magical atmosphere under the water. Snorkel over and watch these magnificent creatures glide through the sea.


  - title: Ambergris Caye
    description: A quintessential tropical paradise, Ambergris Caye has long been a hotspot for island dreamers. This long, thin spit of land is a laid-back ode to idyllic island living, where most of the ‘roads’ are little more than dirt positively encouraging slow, calm traffic of bicycles and golf carts. To the south of the island you’ll find the capital, San Pedro, a town luckily devoid of any high-rises. From there, you’ll find a host of watersports to try, plus boat trips out to the reef for unmissable snorkelling and diving.

      - title: San Pedro
        description: The capital of the island, San Pedro is a collection of colourful Caribbean buildings catering to tourists and locals alike. It’s a great spot for booking excursions to the reef, for diving adventures or adrenaline-fuelled watersports. San Pedro is blessed with a great restaurant scene perfect for sampling Belizean dishes al fresco.

      - title: Hol Chan Marine Reserve
        description: A section of the reef, to the souther part of the island, is a dedicated marine reserve bursting with aquatic life. A renowned snorkelling spot, the shallow stretch offers rare glimpses at an abundance of colourful, tropical fish and coral. In this stretch you’ll find Shark Ray Alley, offering close encounters with these rather docile creatures.

      - title: Unmissable Food &amp; Drink
        description: Island life on Ambergris is all about indulging oneself. Start your day at Estel’s for the best breakfast on the island. Banana pancakes and treasured views make a great start to your day. Choose from Palapa Bar in the north for swim up beers in clear waters, or indulge at the Belize Chocolate Company. Be sure to try ceviche at Lily’s or Hurricane’s, for true island flavours.


  - title: Caye Caulker
    description: Caye Caulker offers much the same island pleasures that its northern neighbour, Ambergris, affords. A sublime tropical landscape set with enviable white-sand beaches, it’s smaller and a fraction quieter than Ambergris. A classic backpacker’s destination, prices are cheaper here, yet with much of the same sublime spots that Belize’s Cayes offer. Caulker is all about taking things slow; recline on stunning beaches, sun yourself silly, saunter into town and indulge in island feasts of seafood and sweet treats.

      - title: Lobsterfest
        description: Caye Caulker comes alive in July, with the annual Lobsterfest offering all things crustacean. From lobster ceviche to lobster ice cream, delight in the irresistable ocean offerings with plenty of music, games and spirited events taking place across the island.

      - title: The Split
        description: Hurricanes split Caye Caulker in half, leaving a northern, mangrove-filled nature reserve separated from the island. Rent a kayak and explore this tropical wonderland, with a host of colourful birds to spot as you slink down quiet waterways. Head back to the Split for chilled out bars with stunning views.

      - title: Swim with Manatees
        description: These loveable sea cows, irresistibly ugly and stupendously charming, are as endangered as they are loveable. Choose from plenty of operators that run boats out to catch these marvellous creatures, but maybe consider which does the most to also protect them. Once there, don your snorkel and spy a rare, enigmatic sight.
