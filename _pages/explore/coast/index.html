        content: This natural curiosity has lured divers to its depths for generations. Ever since Jacques Cousteau named it as one of the top 10 diving spots in the world, it’s been remarkably popular. This underwater sinkhole with its recognisable dark waters, reaches a depth of 410 ft making it the largest of its kind. It’s said the waters clear the deeper you go, revealing the limestone cave features that lie below.

        title: Shark Ray Alley
        content: Swim with sharks! It may go against everything that mother taught you but the docile nurse sharks and impressive southern stingrays offer a rare treat just below the water’s surface. Snorkel over and watch these magnificent creatures glide through the sea.

  - id: ambergris-caye
    title: Ambergris Caye
    content: A quintessential tropical paradise, Ambergris Caye has long been a hotspot for island dreamers. This long, thin spit of land is a laid-back ode to idyllic island living, where most of the ‘roads’ are little more than dirt; encouraging slow, calm traffic of bicycles and golf carts. To the south of the island you’ll find the capital, San Pedro, a town luckily devoid of any high-rises. From there, you’ll find a host of watersports to try, plus boat trips out to the reef for unmissable snorkelling and diving.

    content: Island delights await at Caye Caulker. A sublime tropical landscape set with enviable white-sand beaches, it’s smaller and a fraction quieter than Ambergris. A classic backpacker’s destination, prices are cheaper here, yet with much of the same sublime spots that Belize’s Cayes offer. Caulker is all about taking things slow; recline on stunning beaches, sun yourself silly, saunter into town and indulge in island feasts of seafood and sweet treats.

      - id: the-split
        title: The Split
        content: Hurricanes split Caye Caulker in half, leaving a northern, mangrove-filled nature reserve separated from the island.

        title: Swim with Manatees
        content: These loveable sea cows, irresistibly ugly and stupendously charming, are a precious sight; moreso, that they are endangered. Choose from a host of operators that run boat trips to catch a glimpse these marvellous creatures, but consider also which operator does the most conservation work. Once there, don your snorkel and spy a rare sight.
