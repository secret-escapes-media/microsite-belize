  - title: Maya Ruins
    description: The Maya civilization are one of the most mysterious in the Americas, having built vast cities, mastered astronomy, art and literature, and then inexplicably disappeared. Now, wild jungles are interrupted by vast temple complexes, expertly carved with hieroglyphics that hint at the artistic and intellectual mastery of the Maya. Belize is often lauded as the heartland of this great civilization, with a vast collection of ancient sights to explore. Set in the thickest of rainforest, adventure deep into the wilds to discover these wonders of the mesoamerican world.

      - title: Altun Ha
        description: Though it may not be the biggest, Altun Ha is an iconic Maya site, immortalised on Belizean bank notes and on the label of the classic Belizean beer, Belikin. This easily-accessible complex dates back to around 200 BC, with potentially much older roots. Two large plazas are bookended by pyramids and mounds. Only a small portion of the site has been restored, with plenty still hiding in the thick jungle.

      - title: Xunantunich
        description: Though easily accessible, you’ll still feel like an adventurer having to cross a small river by way of hand-cranked car-ferry. A vast, towering pyramid is beset with detailed carvings, and a climb to the top offers stunning panorama over the river valley. A centre next to the ticket office shows a range of objects dug up during the excavations.

      - title: Lamanai
        description: Head up river to reach this vast Maya site – one of the most impressive in the country. Set on the banks of the New River Lagoon, towering pyramids, ball courts, residential areas and stelae converge on this inspired jungle scene. It’s one of very few Maya cities that was still populated during the Spanish Conquest, suggesting its importance to the people in the area.

  - title: Wildlife
    description: Belize is blessed with an abundance of colourful creatures tucked away in the thick, interior jungle. Vast river valleys and wetlands offer up diversity that has encouraged rich pickings of wildlife to settle in this country. From jaguars to tapirs and macaws to toucans, Belize is a playground of biodiversity. Spot it in a network of dedicated wildlife preserves, eclectic zoos, or just go exploring with your binoculars in hand...

        description: The Community Baboon Sanctuary is an impressive grassroots project that has protected the endangered black howler monkey community, affectionately called baboons. A range of tours will have you spotting everything from monkeys to crocodiles, with nature hikes, river canoe tours, and immersive night tours at your disposal. Alight at Creole villages before heading back into the thick jungle.

      - title: See it all!
        description: Belize Zoo is a feast for the senses. See all the animals Belize is famous for, from tapirs to pumas, gibnuts to coatimundi, and plenty more colourful characters. What sets this zoo apart is the laid-back nature of its enclosures. Animals from the surrounding jungle flit around, climbing in with the tapirs or the peccaries. It really is a wondrous place that evidently does all it can for its residents.
