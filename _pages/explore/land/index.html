    title: Maya temples
    content: The Maya civilization are one of the most mysterious in the Americas, having built vast cities, mastered astronomy, art and literature; then, nothing. They inexplicably disappeared. Now, wild jungles are interrupted by vast temple complexes, expertly carved with hieroglyphics that hint at the artistic and intellectual mastery of the Maya. Belize is often lauded as the heartland of this great civilization, with a vast collection of ancient sights to explore. Set in the thickest of rainforest, adventure deep into the wilds to discover these wonders of the mesoamerican world.

Only a small portion of the site has been restored, with plenty still hiding in the thick jungle.
