  - title: Inspired Natural Sights
    description: Belize offers more awe-inspiring natural wonders than you could ever hope to see in one trip. Natural curiosities like the Blue Hole, vast underground cave networks, thick tropical jungle and of course the longest Barrier Reef in the Western Hemisphere, all combine to make Belize a veritable unspoilt paradise. The world’s first jaguar preserve hints at the incomparable wildlife on offer in Belize. Tropical birds cover a spectrum of song and colour, where in a day you can hang with monkeys in one of many reserves before swimming with sharks along the coast.

  - title: Superlative Dining
    description: Belize’s unique location offers delectable feasts comprised of a myriad of flavours. Its strong point is certainly the seafood plucked from the tropical Caribbean, where lobster and red snapper are enviable staples. Hearty chicken stews are a classic of the Kriol cuisine, and nearly everything in Belize is served up with the classic rice and beans. Chocolate is one of Belize’s most famous exports, so don’t miss the chance to indulge. With influence from Africa, Mexico, the Caribbean and more, Belize’s culinary map is a diverse, mouth-watering experience set to delight any traveller.
