intro: >
  <p class="title title--sm title--italic title--thin title--display">Belize is an utterly beguiling land that still retains an untamed, uncharted mystique.</p>

  <p class="text--lg">It has avoided the the stampede of tourists that tend to unintentionally inspire endless developments and the destruction of natural habitats. Instead, it is a country rooted to its tropical rainforest interior and its Caribbean coastline.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">Land-locked to Central America, it shares some of the cultural heritage, the magnificent landscapes and uniquities of its continent base, whilst also offering the island magic that draws so many to the Caribbean. From vast Maya step pyramids erupting from wild jungle landscapes to exploring the second-largest coral reef in the world, Belize is a land full of surprises.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">If you’ve not considered Belize before, you can be forgiven; but take a look at our guides across this site – Belize is guaranteed to enchant.</p>
