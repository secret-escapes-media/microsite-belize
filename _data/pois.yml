This eco-treasure invites snorkelers and divers to its crystalline waters, offering rare glimpses at an enchanting aquatic world. Tropical fish, sea turtles and manatees will guide you around the stunning reef.

- title: Blue Hole
  description: This natural curiosity has lured divers to its depths for generations. Ever since Jacques Cousteau named it as one of the top 10 diving spots in the world, it’s been remarkably popular. This sinkhole, noticeable by the far darker waters it hosts,  reaches a depth of 410 ft, making it the largest of its kind. It’s said the waters clear the deeper you go, revealing the limestone cave features that lie below.

- title: Swim with Manatees
  description: These loveable sea cows, irresistibly ugly and stupendously charming, are as endangered as they are loveable.

Once there, don your snorkel and spy a rare, enigmatic sight.

- title: Altun Ha
  description: Though it may not be the biggest, Altun Ha is an iconic Maya site, immortalised on Belizean bank notes and on the label of the classic Belizean beer, Belikin. This easily-accessible complex dates back to around 200 BC, with potentially much older roots. Two large plazas are bookended by pyramids and mounds. Only a small portion of the site has been restored, with plenty still hiding in the thick jungle.

- title: Lamanai
  description: Head up river to reach this vast Maya site – one of the most impressive in the country. Set on the banks of the New River Lagoon, towering pyramids, ball courts, residential areas and stelae converge on this inspired jungle scene. It’s one of very few Maya cities that was still populated during the Spanish Conquest, suggesting its importance to the people in the area.

Alight at Creole villages before heading back into the thick jungle.
